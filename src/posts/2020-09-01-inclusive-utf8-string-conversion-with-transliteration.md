With the general availability and widespread support of UTF-8, character encoding issues are slowly
becoming a problem of the past, thankfully. But unfortunately there's still tons of legacy systems
out there that don't support it.

I ran into this exact problem quite recently. I had built a "Book an appointment"-form for a client.
All user input, including the customer's name, needed to be sent to the client's legacy CRM via a
proprietary HTTP API.  
As it turned out, that system only accepts [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") ‚òπÔ∏è.
That's right: _Just_ ASCII, not even [Extended ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII
"Extended ASCII"). Any attempt to send a string with non-ASCII characters resulted in an HTTP
400-error.

## Inclusivity
What's in a name? Well, certainly not only ASCII characters!  
Some people are called Bj√∏rn or Fran√ßois, for example. If Bj√∏rn or Fran√ßois would try to use the
form, they couldn't book an appointment (assuming they'd enter their name including these non-ASCII
characters).

Apart from lost sales by my client, that is not _inclusive_ at all.
[Web inclusivity](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/) means that
anyone, regardless of age and gender but also language or location, should be able to use the web.
So naturally, declining Bj√∏rn and Fran√ßois to use our form just because their names have some "weird
letters", is not acceptable by any means.

I consulted with the client but sadly the problem couldn't (or wouldn't) be fixed on their end, and
they asked if I could provide a solution. So I needed to come up with a way to transform or convert
the user's input into ASCII.

First, let's define what the actual desired result is. I'll be using this fictitious name: `Dani√´l
Ren√©e Fran√ßois Bj√∏rn in‚Äôt Veld`. Every word in this string has a non-ASCII character. If we need to
convert this to ASCII, we should find characters that look similar. In other words, I want the end
result to be: `Daniel Renee Francois Bjorn in't Veld`. In my opinion that is as close as we can get.

You may argue that even converting `Fran√ßois` to `Francois` and `Bj√∏rn` to `Bjorn` isn't inclusive.
They're different letters with different pronunciations. And I agree! That's why I'd like to
emphasize that you should only do this as a last resort only. **If you have any viable ways to
refrain from having to convert user input (e.g. someone's name), you absolutely should!**

But given the choice between a) not being able to use a form at all or b) being called Bjorn, I'm
sure that Bj√∏rn would choose the latter.


Enough talk, let's code! Converting a UTF-8 string to ASCII üòé. Can't be hard, right?

<aside><p>Note: I'll be using PHP, but most examples are applicable to other languages as well.</p></aside>

## The obvious choice: iconv
If you search for _php utf8 to ascii_ `iconv` is the first function that pops up:
> iconv ‚Äî Convert string to requested character encoding  
> Performs a character set conversion on the string `str` from `in_charset` to `out_charset`.

As the [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.iconv.php) states, there are three
"modes" in which iconv can operate: _plain_, _IGNORE_ and _TRANSLIT_. Let's not waste any time and
put it to the test:

```php
<?php
$name = 'Dani√´l Ren√©e Fran√ßois Bj√∏rn in‚Äôt Veld';

$plain    = iconv("UTF-8", "ASCII", $name);
$ignore   = iconv("UTF-8", "ASCII//IGNORE", $name);
$translit = iconv("UTF-8", "ASCII//TRANSLIT", $name);

var_dump($plain, $ignore, $translit);
```
[Run this example on 3v4l.org ¬ª](https://3v4l.org/RREJl) {.c-code-example-link}

Output:
```md
Notice: iconv(): Detected an illegal character in input string in /in/RREJl on line 4
bool(false)
string(32) "Danil Rene Franois Bjrn int Veld"
string(37) "Dani?l Ren?e Fran?ois Bj?rn in't Veld"
```

Well, that's disappointing:

* The _plain_ mode triggered an `E_NOTICE` and returned `false`: it means that iconv detected one or
  more characters that it couldn't fit into the output charset and just gave up;
* The _IGNORE_ mode simply discarded the characters it couldn't fit into ASCII;
* The _TRANSLIT_ mode tried to replace the "special" characters with similarly looking ASCII
  characters, but failed. Except for `‚Äô` ‚Äî the
  [Right Single Quotation Mark](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2019), which is not uncommon in
  Dutch surnames ‚Äî they're all replaced by a question mark.

The PHP docs warn that this may happen: _"TRANSLIT conversion is likely to fail for characters which
are illegal for the out_charset."_ And if you read the comments in the documentation you'll find
that iconv's _TRANSLIT_ mode behaves very inconsistently between different systems. In other words:
you can't rely on iconv's _TRANSLIT_ mode at all. Makes you wonder why they provide it in the first
place ü§î.

Now technically I could've used the _IGNORE_ mode of iconv and be done with it. It doesn't contain
any non-ASCII characters anymore ‚Äì so my API call wouldn't fail anymore. But it's not the result
that I set out for, and it wouldn't be inclusive at all. Again: if my name is Fran√ßois, I want to be
called Fran√ßois, _maybe_ Francois but not Franois and most certainly not Fran?ois.


## Transliteration
Although iconv's _TRANSLIT_ mode doesn't seem usable, I feel we are on the right track with
_transliteration_. So what exactly is transliteration?

Transliteration in the general sense of the word, is "conversion of a text from one script to
another that involves swapping letters in predictable ways"
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration)). It is, for example, the conversion of
`–°—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π` (Cyrillic script) to `Stravinsky` (Latin script).
