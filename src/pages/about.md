## About me
I'm a software developer and engineering manager based in Sambeek, the Netherlands.
I'm currently employed as Head of Development at [MyOnlineStore B.V.](https://www.mijnwebwinkel.nl/),
a Dutch SaaS e-commerce platform.

Most of my development work is done with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), but I'm no stranger to other languages and frameworks.

In my spare time I'm an avid musician (electric guitar, trumpet, tuba) and runner.
