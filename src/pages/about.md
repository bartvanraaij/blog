## About me
I'm a software developer and engineering manager based in Sambeek, the Netherlands.
I'm currently employed as Lead Cloud and Web Developer at [AgXeed](https://www.agxeed.com/),

Next to work I'm a father, musician (electric guitar, trumpet, tuba), DIY enthusiast, and Counter-Strike player (forever stuck in Silver).
