## About me
I'm a software developer turned manager based in Sambeek, the Netherlands.
I'm currently employed as Head of Development at [MyOnlineStore](https://www.mijnwebwinkel.nl/),
a Dutch SaaS e-commerce platform, and part of [Visma](https://www.visma.com).

Next to work I'm a father, musician (electric guitar, trumpet, tuba), DIY enthusiast, and Counter-Strike player (forever stuck in Silver).
