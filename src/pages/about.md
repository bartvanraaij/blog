## About me
I'm Bart, a web developer based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I'm currently employed as Development
Team Lead at [Linku](https://linku.nl), where I work with a team of talented people to create
bespoke web applications, websites and mobile apps.

Most of my development work is done with either [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and
[Symfony](https://symfony.com/) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[Angular](https://angular.io/), but I like to dabble in other languages and frameworks as well.

In my spare time I'm an avid musician (electric guitar and the tuba) and I like to tell people I'm a
runner but in all honesty my Netflix account has way more activity in it than my Runkeeper's.
