## About me
I'm a web developer based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I'm currently employed as _tech team lead_ at [Coolblue](https://www.coolblue.nl), 
one of the largest Dutch e-commerce companies.

Most of my development work is done with either [PHP](https://www.php.net/) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but I'm no stranger to other languages and frameworks.

In my spare time I'm an avid musician (electric guitar and the tuba) and runner.
