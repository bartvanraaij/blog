## About me
I'm a web developer based in Sambeek, the Netherlands. I'm currently employed as backend developer at [Mijnwebwinkel](https://www.mijnwebwinkel.nl/), 
a Dutch all-in-one e-commerce SaaS platform.

Most of my development work is done with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), but I'm no stranger to other languages and frameworks.

In my spare time I'm an avid musician (electric guitar and the tuba) and runner.
